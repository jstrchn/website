abstract: Human social life rests on our ability to coordinate decisions. A particular challenge is to converge on decisions without being able to communicate. It has been shown that people achievecoordination by relying on saliency – choosing the option that stands out the most. However, in life there is often more than one salient option. We developed a Schelling-point coordination game with three levels of item saliency to test coordination under cases of ambiguity. We predicted that the coordination strategy people choose in ambiguous situations depends on how similar one's intuitions are to others’ and one’s willingness to consider a partner’s perspective. These two factors are encapsulated in generalised attitudes of trust. We found that participants were worse at coordinating than would be expected of a saliency strategy, and highly trusting people were worse coordinators than distrusting people. Our findings reveal the unexpected negative consequences of pro-social attitudes on saliency-based coordination. A preregistered fourth experiment is planned to test the hypothesis that these negative consequences are driven by overthinking about the partner during coordination. 

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
# summary: Previous research shows that people use saliency to coordinate decisions without communicating, but there may be competition for saliency in the real world, and people do not always agree on what solutions stand out. In these more complex situations, the way we perceive others and our attitude towards them may be critical. Specifically, trust may become an influential factor as we try to anticipate what our partner will choose. We developed a coordination task with competition for saliency and find not only that people are worse at coordinating than they would be by using a saliency strategy, but also that highly trusting people are worse coordinators than distrusting people despite showing higher agreement on which items are salient. This suggests that trusting participants may overthink their decisions when coordinating that leads them to search for alternative coordination strategies, resulting in a counter-intuitive drop in coordination success.
