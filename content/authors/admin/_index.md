I am a MINDED Researcher on the Marie Curie COFUND Project [MINDED](https://minded-cofund.eu), working at the [Italian Institute of Technology](http://iit.it) in Genoa, Italy. I work as part of the [Cognition, Motion, and Neuroscience Unit](https://www.iit.it/research/lines/cognition-motion-and-neuroscience) with Professor [Cristina Becchio](https://www.iit.it/it/people/cristina-becchio). I am currently working on understanding how teachers adjust their actions during live pedagogical interactions to effectively structure and communicate information, with a particular focus on the role of motor variability.

Before joining IIT, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the [Social Mind and Body lab](http://somby.ceu.edu) at the Central European University [Department of Cognitive Science](https://cognitivescience.ceu.edu) with Professors [Natalie Sebanz](http://somby.ceu.edu/people/natalie-sebanz) and [G&uuml;nther Knoblich](http://somby.ceu.edu/people/gunther-knoblich). I completed my PhD at the University of York under the supervision of [Professor Steve Tipper](https://www.york.ac.uk/psychology/staff/emeritusfaculty/steventipper/), looking at incidental learning of trust from gaze cues.
