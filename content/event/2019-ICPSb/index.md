location: Palais des Congres de Paris, Paris, France

summary: Poster presented at the International Convention of Psychological Science (ICPS) 2019, Paris, March 7-9
abstract: "In joint actions, individual actors prioritise the efficiency of the joint action even if this means being individually inefficient. However, it is not known whether fairness plays a role in these decisions. We present a paradigm that explores whether participants prioritise efficiency when efficient options require unfair task distributions."
