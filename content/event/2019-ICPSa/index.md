summary: Talk delivered as part of *Where Do Our Expectations Lead Us? the Effects of Commitment and Trust on Cognition, Joint Action, and Communication*, symposium at the International Convention of Psychological Science (ICPS) 2019, Paris, March 7-9
abstract: "People in a distrust mindset find alternative solutions to problems that often involve using unexpected strategies. This poses a problem for coordination, where two people must predict each other's actions to achieve a consensus. We present a series of experiments looking at the role of distrust in coordinated decision-making."
